# Version 0 of B<sup>Îµ</sup>-Trees

This version makes heavy use of [persistence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf) and [laziness](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/COURSES/GATECH/CSE-Algs-Fall2013/papers/Arg03.pdf) and [batching](http://brics.dk/RS/96/28/BRICS-RS-96-28.pdf).

## Deletions
Our deletion algorithm is derived from [this paper](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/85/1/1995-19.pdf).

## Balancing the tree
